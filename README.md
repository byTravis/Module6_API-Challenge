## API Challenge Description
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, I'm taking what I've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, I know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would I prove that?

## Instructions
- **Part 1:  WeatherPy**
  - Create plots to showcase the relationship between the following:  
    - Latitude vs. Temperature
    - Latitude vs. Humidity
    - Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    - Latitude vs. Wind Speed
  - Divide the cities between northern and southern hemisphere and compute linear regression for each relationship.
- **Part 2:  VacationPy**
  - Create a map that displays a point for every city.  The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
  - Narrow down city data to find your ideal weather condition. 
  - For each city, find a hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
  - Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message.
